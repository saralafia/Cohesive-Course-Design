## What are Backward Design and Constructive Alignment?

[Backward design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_design) is a method of designing educational curriculum by setting goals before choosing instructional methods and forms of assessment. Backward design of curriculum typically involves three stages: Identify the results desired (big ideas and skills)...

[Constructive alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_alignment) is a principle used for devising teaching and learning activities, and assessment tasks, that directly address the intended learning outcomes (ILOs) in a way not typically achieved in traditional lectures, tutorial classes and examinations (Biggs and Tang, 2011)...

## How can these theories inform course design?


## What are some best practices and takeaways?

## How do faculty design cohesive courses at UCSB?
We interviewed several award-winning faculty at UCSB who are putting these teaching theories into practice. To better understand the process, we asked the following questions:

1. What were the key concepts for your courses and how did you assess students based on them? Do you start with ideas for activities, weekly questions, etc?
2. How have you structured your classes? (chronologically, weekly questions, thematically, etc). Has it changed over time?

1. I minimize the time spent on assessment in large undergraduate courses. It cannot be done in a way that provides constructive feedback given the resources available. Or, more accurately, if we did do assessment in that way, it would leave no time for teaching - intellectual development and skill acquisition.  Rather, I treat assessment exclusively as a means of incentivizing student effort, so that the time spent teaching is productive time.  I use problem sets for homework to make student engage with skills and concepts; multiple choice tests to make them study; and course participation scores to reward students who are making efforts but falling short due to excessive work commitments or lacuna in their prior education.
2.  Each course is structured around an "itinerary." I start with a list of concepts/ideas/debates with which they should be familiar. Then I fiddle a lot with sequencing to determine which ones build on knowledge of the others.  Then I order them chronologically, starting from the ground up. Readings are selected last, as a means of backstopping the ideas.

1. There's no magic to what I do. The key to being a good teacher, I think, is (1) caring and (2) continuing to push yourself, sometimes in the absence of strong incentives, to do better.My introductory ES course seeks to develop critical thinking skills. I define "critical thinking" as the ability to analyze diverse forms of evidence and assess competing claims. For this reason, I privilege concepts over content. My threshold concepts for ES 1 include things like change, complexity, interdisciplinarity, justice, and power. 
2. I used to assess students based on take-home assignments and exams. This year, however, I radically changed the structure of the course, throwing out the take home assignments and eliminating the final exam. I kept the midterms (to make sure students were following along and getting the basic, nuts and bolts ideas), and I replaced the rest with a 5-step scaffolded term paper. The paper was 8-10 pages long; the instructions were 13. Making this change was a big risk, but it paid off. Students were required to bring in key concepts from the lectures and readings, follow the multiple steps, and hone important research and writing skills. Yet they were able to pick a topic of their choice and do a deep dive into it. A few things need changing, but overall it worked out great.
